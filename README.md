# socket-manager
a multipurpose socket handler and manager module designed to streamline common things i do with sockets and make handling many sockets easier
# socket tester
this program is designed to help test socket connections when working on a server as custom data can be sent or recieved
allowing you to fix bugs and work on new features.
currently it autoconnects to any sockets on your current machine and scans from port 8000 to port 9000. you can edit the code if you want to change this.
finaly, it currently only acts as a client, but maybe i will update it to mimic a server later.
